PESSIMAL PACKING SHAPES

YOAV KALLUS

Abstract. We address the question of which convex shapes, when
packed as densely as possible under certain restrictions, fill the least
space and leave the most empty space. In each different dimen-
sion and under each different set of restrictions, this question is
expected to have a different answer or perhaps no answer at all.
As the problem of identifying global minima in most cases appears
to be beyond current reach, in this paper we focus on local min-
ima. We review some known results and prove these new results:
in two dimensions, the regular heptagon is a local minimum of
the double-lattice packing density, and in three dimensions, the
directional derivative (in the sense of Minkowski addition) of the
double-lattice packing density at the point in the space of shapes
corresponding to the ball is in every direction positive.

1. Introduction

An n-dimensional convex body is a convex, compact, subset of Rn
with nonempty interior. The space of convex bodies, denoted Kn, can
be endowed with the Hausdorff metric:

dist(K,K ′) = min{ε : K ′ ⊆ Kε and K ⊆ K ′ε},
where Kε = {x + y : x ∈ K, ||y|| ≤ ε} is the ε-parallel body of K.

A set of isometries Ξ is said to be admissible for K if the interiors
of ξ(K) and ξ′(K) are disjoint for all distinct ξ, ξ′ ∈ Ξ. The (lower)
mean volume of Ξ can be defined as d(Ξ) = lim infr→∞(4πr

3/3)/|{ξ ∈
Ξ : ||ξ(0)|| < r}|. The collection {ξ(K) : ξ ∈ Ξ} for an admissible Ξ is
called a packing of K and said to be produced by Ξ. Its density is the
fraction of space it fills: vol(K)/d(Ξ). The packing density of a body
K, denoted δ(K) is the supremum of vol(K)/d(Ξ) over all admissible
sets of isometries. Groemer proves some basic results about packing
densities, including the fact that the supremum is actually achieved
by some packing and the fact that δ(K) is continuous [10]. Groemer’s
result apply also to the restricted packing densities which we define
below.

An inversion about a point x is the isometry Ix : y 7→ 2x−y. While
the group of isometries of Rn is not preserved under conjugation by
an affine transformation of Rn, the subgroup made of all translations
and inversions about points is invariant. It is interesting to consider
packings produced by sets of only translations and inversions. The
supremum of vol(K)/d(Ξ) over packings restricted in this way, denoted
δT ∗(K), is preserved under affine transformations of K and therefore
we may say that the domain of δT ∗(K) is the space of affine equiva-
lence classes of convex bodies. Macbeath showed that this space (with
the induced topology) is compact [16], and so δT ∗ achieves a global
minimum.

Similarly, we may restrict to packings produced only by a set of
translations, produced only by the set of elements of a group of trans-
lations (namely a Bravais lattice, or simply lattice hence), or produced
only by the set of elements of a group of translations and inversions
(namely a double lattice, after G. Kuperberg and W. Kuperberg [15]),
and define respectively δT (K), δL(K), and δL∗(K) in the obvious way.
By the same argument as for δT ∗(K), all these functions must also
achieve a global minimum. The following problem has been suggested,
for example by A. Bezdek and W. Kuperberg [1] (but see also Ref. [2]):

Problem 1. In n dimensions, what are the minima of δT , δT ∗, δL, and
δL∗? Which bodies achieve these minima?

Fáry showed that in two dimensions, triangles are the unique mini-
mum of δL [6, 3]. Also, due to a result of L. Fejes Tóth, δL = δT in two
dimensions, so triangles also minimize δT [7, 20].

A body K is said to be centrally symmetric (c.s.) if there is a point
x such that Ix(K) = K. It is reasonable to restrict the functions
δT and δL to the space Kn0 of c.s. bodies and ask for the minima of
these restricted functions, since these bodies correspond to unit balls
in finite-dimensional Banach spaces. Therefore the following question
is natural to ask:

Problem 2. In n dimensions, what are the minima of δT and δL among
c.s. bodies? Which bodies achieve these minima?

In two dimensions, Reinhardt conjectured that a certain smoothed
octagon – a regular octagon whose corners are rounded off by arcs of
hyperbolas – minimizes δL [19, 17]. Due to the same result of L. Fejes
Tóth, we have that δ(K) = δT (K) = δL(K) for c.s. bodies K in two
dimensions [7].

By contrast to the functions considered in Problems 1–2, δ(K) is
not invariant under affinities, but only under isometries and dilations.

ing shapes. The Reinhardt octagon has a one-parameter
family of optimal lattices, each of which fills 0.90241 . . .

shape. The top row shows three examples from this fam-
ily. The densest lattice packing of triangles (bottom left)
fills 2/3 of the plane and is less dense than the densest
lattice packing of any other shape. The densest double-
lattice packing of regular heptagons (bottom right) fills
0.89269 . . . of the plane and is conjectured to be less dense
than the densest double-lattice packing of any other
shape.

Therefore, its infimum over all bodies (which is bounded from below
by the minimum of δT ∗) is in theory not necessarily achieved by any
particular body. In three dimensions, the claim that the ball is the
minimum of δ(K) has come to be known as Ulam’s packing conjecture,
due to a remark Gardner attributes to Ulam, though there is no ev-
idence to confirm that Ulam ever stated it as a conjecture [8]. More
generally, it is natural to ask,

Problem 3. In n dimensions, what is the infimum of δ? Is this infi-
mum achieved by some body?

So far, with the exception of the case of δT and δL in two dimensions
and the trivial case of one dimension, none of the problems 1–3 have
been solved in any dimension. There are two kinds of partial answers
that have been successfully obtained: lower bounds and local minima.
In this paper we will focus on the results of the second kind and content
ourselves with a few references to results of the first kind [15, 23, 5, 12].

Each of the problems 1–3 lends itself to a local variation: which bodies
are a local minimum of the function in question? In two dimensions,
Nazarov showed that Reinhardt’s smoothed octagon is a local mini-
mum of δL (and therefore also δT ) among c.s. bodies [18]. In three
dimensions, I showed that the ball is a local minimum of δL among c.s.
bodies [13], and therefore also a local minimum of δT and δ among c.s.
bodies, due to Hales’s confirmation of Kepler’s conjecture [11].

In this paper we show that the regular heptagon is a local minimum
of δL∗ . Also, failing to show that the three-dimensional ball is a local
minimum of δ, we show that the directional derivative at the ball with
respect to Minkowski addition is positive in all directions.

2. The regular heptagon

Let K be a two-dimensional convex body (hence, domain) of area
A. We say that a chord is an affine diameter of K if it is at least
as long as all parallel chords, and we call its length the length of K
in its direction. We say an inscribed parallelogram is a half-length
parallelogram if one pair of sides is half the length of K in the direction
parallel to them. G. Kuperberg and W. Kuperberg have shown that
in two dimensions δL∗(K) = A/2∆(K), where ∆(K) is the area of
the half-length parallelogram of least area inscribed in K [15]. They
also show that δL∗(K) ≥

√
3/2 = 0.86602 . . . for all domains K [15].

Doheny shows that this bound is not sharp [4]. Here we show that the
regular heptagon, for which δL∗(M) = 0.89269 . . . (exact value below),
is a local minimum. It is reasonable to conjecture that this is also a
global minimum.

For definiteness, let us fix a regular heptagon M with vertices mi =
Ri(1, 0), i = 0, . . . , 6 where Ri is a counter-clockwise rotation by 2πi/7
about the origin (we understand the label i to take values in Z/7Z).
The coordinates of the vertices are then in the field extension Q(u, v),
where u = cosπ/7 and v = sinπ/7, and we will give all explicit numbers
below in the reduced form a+bu+cu2 +v(d+eu+fu2). The least-area
half-length parallelogram inscribed in M (see Figure 2) is the rectangle
p1p2p3p4, where p1 = (1− a)m1 + am2, p2 = (1− b)m2 + bm3, p3 =
(1−b)m5+bm4, p4 = (1−a)m6+am5, a = 74−2u

2, and b = −1
2
+u2. As

the area of this rectangle is given by ∆ = (−19+2u+56u2)v/8 and the
area of the heptagon is given by A = 7uv, the double-lattice packing
density of M is A/2∆ = 2

97
(−111 + 492u− 356u2) = 0.89269 . . .. This

rectangle, of course is one of seven equivalent rectangles Ri(p1p2p3p4),
i = 0, . . . , 6.

Figure 2. The half-length parallelogram of least area
inscribed in the regular heptagon.

Let us now consider a different domain M ′, with area A′ and least-
area half-length parallelogram of area ∆′. We will be interested in the
limit that M ′ becomes more and more similar to M . Therefore, let us
assume that (1 − ε)M ⊆ M ′ ⊆ (1 + ε)M , and we will explore what
happens as we let ε approach 0. We wish to prove that there exists
ε > 0 such that A′/2∆′ ≥ A/2∆ for all M ′. We will prove this in two
steps: we first prove that A′/2∆′ ≥ A/2∆ if M ′ is also a heptagon, and
then we prove that M ′ is a heptagon if A′/2∆′ ≤ A/2∆.
Theorem 1. There exists ε > 0 such that if M ′ is a heptagon and
(1 − ε)M ⊆ M ′ ⊆ (1 + ε)M then A′/2∆′ ≥ A/2∆, with equality only
when M ′ is affinely equivalent to M .

Proof. Let the vertices of M ′ be m′i = R
i(1 + xi, yi), i = 0, . . . , 6. De-

note by x the vector (x0, y0, x1, . . . , x6, y6) ∈ R14. By the affine invari-
ance of the double-lattice packing density, we may assume without loss
of generality that x lies, say, in the 8-dimensional subspace W ⊆ R14,
consisting of all vectors such that x0 = x2 = x5 = y0 = y2 = y5 = 0.
Note that ||x|| ≤ Cε (here and below, we use C and c to denote con-
stants, whose exact value is irrelevant to the argument and which may
be different from line to line, but have no implicit dependence on any



6 YOAV KALLUS

variable). We will assume that A′/2∆′ ≤ A/2∆, and show that we
necessarily then have that M ′ = M .

Consider the altitude dropped from each vertex m′i of M
′ to the

opposite edge m′i+3m
′
i+4 and label the point of intersection k

′
i. The

chord m′ik
′
i is an affine diameter of M

′. Consider also for each i, the two
chords parallel to m′ik

′
i but of half its length, and let the parallelogram

formed by them be of area ∆i. Let φi =
A′/2∆i
A/2∆

−1. By our assumption,
φi ≤ 0 for all i.

Consider φi as a function of x. This function depends analytically
on x in a neighborhood of the origin. Within this neighborhood, we
may bound φi(x) using its Taylor series

φi(x) ≥ 〈fi,x〉+ 12〈x, Fix〉 − C||x||
3,

where the explicit values of fi and Fi are given in Tables 1 and 2.
We note that there exist coefficients ci > 0 such that

∑6
i=0 cifi = 0,

namely ci = 1 for all i. It follows from the fundamental theorem of
linear algebra that 〈fi,x〉 ≤ 0 for all i if and only if
(1) 〈fi,x〉 = 0 for all i.
The intersection of the space of solutions to (1) with W is the two-
dimensional space spanned by the two vectors given in Table 1. We
denote the orthogonal projection to this space as P . Note that (by a
compactness argument) 〈fi,x〉 ≥ c||(1 − P )x|| for at least one i, and
so it follows from the assumption that φi(x) ≤ 0 for all i and the fact
that φi ≥ 〈fi,xi〉 − C||x||2 that ||(1 − P )x|| ≤ C||x||2. Therefore we
also have that

φi(x) ≥ 〈fi, (1− P )x〉+ 12〈x, PFiPx〉 − C||x||
3.

By direct calculation, we observe that PFiP is positive definite (when
restricted to the image of P ) for all i, and so 1

2
〈x, PFiPx〉 ≥ c||Px||2.

Therefore, 0 ≥ φi ≥ c||(1 − P )x|| + c′||Px||2 − C||x||3 for at least one
i, and if ε is small enough then x = 0 necessarily. �

Theorem 2. There exists ε > 0 such that if (1−ε)M ⊆M ′ ⊆ (1+ε)M
then A′/2∆′ ≥ A/2∆, with equality only when M ′ is affinely equivalent
to M .

Proof. We now allow M ′ to be an arbitrary domain, not necessarily a
heptagon. Consider the length of M as a function of direction. This
function has seven local minima, corresponding to the chords from each
vertex mi to the midpoint of the opposite edge ki. The corresponding
function for M ′ must also, when ε is sufficiently small, have at least
seven local minima realized by chords m′ik

i, where ||m′i −mi||, ||k′i −

of the boundary above the chord at the point (1 − t)m′i + tm′i+1 on
the chord (see Figure 4). Denote the corresponding boundary point
pi(t). The domain M

i and

the functions hi(t), i = 0, . . . , 6. However, we intend to use only the
points m′i and k

i and the values hi(a), hi(b), hi(1− b), and hi(1− a).

Note that given the value of, say, hi(t0), we can bound near-by values

Let us consider φi as a function of x = (x0, y0, x1, y1, . . . , y6) ∈ R14,

analytic in any neighborhood of the origin in R14 × R42. However, it
does, everywhere in such a neighborhood, take the value of one of 16
analytic functions (let us call them φij(x,x

′), j = 1, . . . , 16), based on
whether t > t0 or not at the point of contact of the paralellogram with
each of the four replacement boundary arcs. When x′ = 0 all sixteen
functions agree. Also, the first derivatives of φij with respect to any
component taken at the origin are independent of j. Therefore, we
have that

φi(x,x
′) ≥ φi(x, 0) + 〈f ′i ,x′〉 − C||x′||(||x||+ ||x′||).

where

α(p,p′,p′′) = p ∧ p′ + p′ ∧ p′′ + p′′ ∧ p
is the oriented area of the triangle pp′p′′. From the fact that m′ik

′
i is

a locally shortest length, we have that a line through k′i perpendicular
to this length is tangent to M ′, and therefore ψi ≥ 0 for i = 1, . . . , 14.
That ψi ≥ 0 for i = 15, . . . , 42 simply follows from convexity. These
functions are all analytic in a neighborhood of the origin, and therefore
we have that

ψi(x,x
′) ≤ ψi(x, 0) + 〈g′i,x′〉+ C||x′||(||x||+ ||x′||).

Moreover, note that ψi(x, 0) = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , 42. For explicit
values of g′i, see Table 3.

There exist coefficients ci > 0, i = 0, . . . , 6, and di > 0, i = 1, . . . , 42,
such that

〈f ′i ,x′〉 ≤ 0 for i = 0, . . . , 6 and
〈g′i,x′〉 ≥ 0 for i = 1, . . . , 42,

then we have equality for all of the above. The solution space turns
out to be trivial. From compactness there must be a constant C such
that at least one of the following equations holds for at least one i

〈f ′i ,x′〉 ≥ C||x′|| or
〈g′i,x′〉 ≤ −C||x′||.

Therefore, it follows from the fact that φi ≤ 0 and ψi ≥ 0 for all i, that
there exists ε such that if ||x||, ||x′|| < ε then x′ = 0. If x′ = 0, then
from convexity hi(t) = 0 for all i = 0, . . . , 6 and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, and M ′ is
a heptagon. From Theorem 1 M ′ is affinely equivalent to M . �

Conjecture. The regular heptagon is an absolute minimum of δL∗ in
two dimensions.

If, as might very well be the case, δ(M) = δL∗(M), then the conjec-
ture would also imply that M is a minimum of δ.

3. The 3-ball

Let K and K ′ be convex bodies and let λ, λ′ ≥ 0 not both equal
to 0, then the set λK + λ′K ′ = {λx + λ′x′ : x ∈ K,x ∈ K ′} is also
a convex body. This operation is known as the Minkowski sum. A
convex body K ⊆ Rn can be specified by its support height function
hK : S

n−1 → R, given by hK(x) = maxy∈K〈x,y〉. Minkowski addition
corresponds to addition of the support height functions: hλK+λ′K′(x) =
λhK(x) +λ

′hK′(x). The mean width of a body K is the average length
of its projection onto a randomly chosen axis. It is given by

w =
2
∫
Sn−1

hKdσ

σ(Sn−1)
,

where σ is the Lebesgue measure on Sn−1. Out of all linear images TK
of a body K, there is a unique one up to rotation which minimizes w
while preserving the volume [9]. This is known as the minimal-mean-
width position of K, and a body is in its minimal-mean-width position
if and only if∫

Sn−1
hK(x)〈·,x〉2dσ(x) = (w/2n)σ(Sn−1)|| · ||2.

Steiner’s formula gives the volume of the body Kλ = (1 − λ)B + λK,
interpolating between the unit ball B (λ = 0) and the body K (λ = 1).
In three dimensions, Steiner’s formula can be written as

(3) vol(K) = 4π
3

(1− λ)3 + 2πwλ+ S(K)λ2(1− λ) + λ3 vol(K),
where S(K) is the surface area of K [21].

In this section we prove the following result about the unit ball and
the double-lattice packing density of nearly spherical bodies:

Theorem 3. Let K be a three-dimensional body in minimal-mean-
width position. If K is not a ball, then there exist numbers λ0(K) > 0
and β(K) > 0 such that

δL∗ ((1− λ)B + λK)− δL∗(B) > β(K)λ,
for all 0 < λ < λ0(K).

The double-lattice packing density of B is π/
√

18. It is realized,
for example, by its optimal lattice packing, the face-centered cubic
lattice (f.c.c.), which can be described degenerately as a double lat-
tice. It is also realized by the hexagonally closed packed structure
(h.c.p.), which is not a Bravais lattice. We fix a realization of the



PESSIMAL PACKING SHAPES 11

h.c.p. structure in which the unit ball centered at the origin shares
the following twelve boundary points with neighboring balls: x1 =
(1, 0, 0), x2 = (1/2,

2/3), x11 = x10 − x1, and x12 = x10 − x2. The

double lattice Ξ, of mean volume d(Ξ) = 4
√

2, is generated by trans-
lations by 2x1 and 2x2 and by inversions about x7 and x10. Let P be
the polyhedron {x ∈ R3 : 〈x,xi〉 ≤ 1 for all i = 1, . . . , 12}, then P is
the Voronoi cell of the h.c.p. structure.

The double lattice Ξ is admissible for P too, producing a packing
of density 1, namely a tiling. Specifically, this is a face-to-face tiling
in the strong sense that every two cells share a face or do not touch
at all. We show now that if K is a nearly spherical convex body, we
can bound its double-lattice packing density using the values hK(xi),
i = 1, . . . , 12.

Lemma 1. Let K be a convex body satisfying (1−ε)B ⊆ K ⊆ (1+ε)B.
For sufficiently small ε, a double-lattice Ξ′ exists, admissible for K,
such that d(Ξ′) ≤ d(Ξ)η(K)3, where η(K) = 1

Proof. Without loss of generality, let us assume that

Let us label hi = hK(xi) and consider be the polyhedron P

′ = {x ∈
R3 : 〈x,xi〉 ≤ hi for all i = 1, . . . , 12}. The projection of P ′ onto the
xy-plane is a hexagon. Let a1 and a2 be the vectors in the xy-plane
generating the densest lattice packing of this hexagon. In particular,
for ε small enough, there is a unique choice such that ||a1−2x2||, ||a2−
2x2|| < Cε. Now, let x′7, x′8, and x′9, be the unique points satisfying
〈x′i,xi〉 = hi for i = 7, 8, 9, x′8 = x′7− 12a1, and x

let x′10, x

12, be the unique points satisfying 〈x′i,xi〉 = hi for

i = 10, 11, 12, x′11 = x

10− 12a1, and x

12 = x

10− 12a2. Now let Ξ

′ be the
double lattice generated by translations by a1 and a2 and by inversions
about x′7 and x

′
10. We note that for each face of P

′ there is a neighbor
ξ′(P ′), ξ′ ∈ Ξ′, such that P ′ and ξ′(P ′) touch along this face. For small
enough ε, this is enough to conclude that Ξ′ is admissible for P ′, since
in the packing Ξ(P ) there are only face-to-face contacts. A fortiori, Ξ′

is also admissible for K.
As a1, a2, x

Lemma 2. Let

cl = Pl(1) + 4Pl(
1
2
) + 2Pl(0) + Pl(−13) + 2Pl(−

1
2
) + 2Pl(−56),

where Pl(t) is the Legendre polynomial of degree l. Then cl = 0 if and
only if l = 1 or l = 2.

Proof. We introduce the following rescaled Legendre polynomials: Ql(t)
= 6ll!Pl(t). From their recurrence relation—given by Ql+1(t) = (2l +
1)(6t)Ql(t)− 36l2Ql−1(t)—and the base cases—Q0(t) = 1 and Q1(t) =
6t— it is clear that the values of Ql(t) at t = k/6 for k = −6, . . . , 6 are
integers. If Ql(k/6) ≡ Ql+1(k/6) ≡ 0 (mod 8) for some k and l then
for all l′ ≥ l, Ql′(k/6) ≡ 0 (mod 8). This is the case for k = 0, 2, 6 and
l = 3, as can be easily checked.

For k = 3 and k = 5 it is easy to show by induction that the residue
of Ql(k/6) modulo 8 depends only on k and the residue of l modulo 4
and takes the following values:

Ql(1/2) ≡ 1, 3, 7, 1 (mod 8)
Ql(5/6) ≡ 1, 5, 7, 7 (mod 8)

resp. for l ≡ 0, 1, 2, 3 (mod 4).
Therefore, when l ≥ 3 is odd, then 6ll!cl = Ql(1)− 2Ql(56) + 2Ql(

1
2
)−

Ql(
1
3
) ≡ 4 (mod 8), and therefore cannot vanish. When l ≥ 3 is even,

then 6ll!cl = Ql(1) + 2Ql(
5
6
) + 6Ql(

1
2
) +Ql(

and again cannot vanish. This leaves only the cases c0 = 12, c1 = 0,
and c2 = 0 to be calculated manually. �

Lemma 3. Let K be a three-dimensional body in minimal-mean-width
position. If K is not a ball then there is a body K ′, isometric to K,
such that η(K ′) < 1

2
w, where w is the mean width of K.

Proof. Note that if K ′ = R(K) is a rotation of K about the origin, then
hK′(x) = hK(R

Tx). Let us pick a point y ∈ S2, and let R0 be some
rotation such that R0(y) = x7. Let Rθ be the rotation obtained by
composing R0 with a rotation by θ about the axis through x7, so that
Rθ(y) = x7 for all 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. Now let g(y) = (1/2π)

∫ 2π
0
η(Rθ(K))dθ,

and repeat this definition for all y ∈ S2.
The function g(y) is given by integrating hK(x) over a measure

µy(x). The measures µy(x) are each invariant under rotations about



PESSIMAL PACKING SHAPES 13

the axis through y, and are related to each other by rotations. Such an
operation hK(x) 7→ g(y) is known as a convolution by the zonal mea-
sure µp(x), where p is some arbitrary pole. (see Ref. [22] for results
about convolutions with zonal measures). The measure µp is given by

12µp({x : 〈p,x〉 ∈ (t1, t2)}) = |{i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 12} : 〈x7,xi〉 ∈ (t1, t2)}| .
We can expand µp(x) into spherical harmonics to obtain

µp(x) =
1
12

∞∑
l=0

clPl(〈x,p〉),

where cl are the coefficients of Lemma 2. It follows that if hK(x) =∑∞
l=0 hl(x) is the expansion of hK into spherical harmonics, then g(x) =

1
12

∑∞
l=0 clhl(x) [22]. The l = 0 term of g(x), giving its average value,

is equal to that of hK(x), namely w/2. Because K is in minimal-mean-
width position, h2 = 0. Therefore, by Lemma 2, g(x) is constant if and
only if the spherical harmonics expansion of hK terminates at l = 1,
which in turn is equivalent to K being a ball. Since we assume K is
not a ball, then g(x) is not constant and must achieve a value below its
average. Since this value corresponds in turn to an average of values
of η(R(K)) over a set of rotations R, it must be no smaller than the
minimum value among these rotations. Therefore, there is a rotation
R such that η(R(K)) < w/2. �

We now prove Theorem 3.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that vol(K) = vol(B)
and that K is rotated such that η(K) < w/2. Let Kλ = (1−λ)B+λK,
then η(Kλ) = 1 + (η(K) − 1)λ. The isoperimetric inequality, S(K) >
S(B), and Steiner’s formula (3) give

vol(Kλ)

vol(B)

The claim of the theorem now follows immediately from Lemma 1. �

Conjecture. The ball is a local minimum of δL∗ in two dimensions.

It does not seem that the ball is a global minimum of δL∗ . For
example, the densest-known double-lattice packing of the tetrahedron
T has a density of only 1

369
(139 + 40

√
10) = 0.71948 . . ., so probably

δL∗(T ) < δL∗(B) [14]. Still, if the conjecture holds, then the ball would
also be a local minimum of δ, verifying a local version of Ulam’s con-
jecture.

4. Discussion

We conclude with a summary of known results and open problems.
Recall from the introduction that problems 1–3 ask for bodies that
minimize the functions δ, δL, δL∗ , δT , or δT ∗ either among all convex
bodies or among only c.s. bodies. There are only two case that are
solved: the minimum of δL and δT in two dimensions among all convex
bodies is 2/3, as realized by triangles alone [6, 3]. A. Bezdek and
W. Kuperberg comment that determining the minima in the unsolved
cases “seems to be a very challenging problem, perhaps too difficult to
expect to be solved in foreseeable future” [1]. Determining local minima
seems to be a more approachable problem, and so far the following local
minima have been identified:

• Reinhardt’s smoothed octagon is a local minimum of δL and of
δT among c.s. bodies in two dimensions [18].
• The ball is a local minimum of δL and of δT among c.s. bodies

in three dimensions [13].
• The regular heptagon is a local minimum of δL∗ among all con-

vex bodies in two dimensions (Section 2).

Note that the present work is the only case in the list above of a lo-
cal minimum among all convex bodies. Reinhardt’s smoothed octagon
possesses the property that its lattice packing density is achieved simul-
taneously by a one-parameter family of lattices (see Figure 1). In fact
this property, common to all so-called irreducible domains (domains
all of whose proper subdomains have admissible lattices of lower mean
area), has long been a central organizing idea in the study of Rein-
hardt’s conjecture [17]. Therefore, it might be surprising to some that
the heptagon, despite being irreducible with respect to double lattices,
does not have a one parameter family of optimal admissible double
lattices.

We end with three open problems:

• The conjecture that the ball is a global minimum of δ among
convex bodies in three dimensions has been attributed to Ulam
[8]. A weaker claim, that the ball is a local minimum of δ, is
open. It is also possible that the ball is a local minimum of
δT ∗ or of δL∗ , as we conjecture here (Section 3). Either of these
possibilities necessarily imply that the ball is a local minimum
of δ, but they do not necessarily follow from Ulam’s conjecture.
• The regular heptagon is conjectured to be a local minimum of
δ among convex bodies in two dimensions. This would follow



PESSIMAL PACKING SHAPES 15

immediately if the packing density of the regular heptagon is
shown to be equal to its double-lattice packing density.
• In four dimensions, it is known that the ball is not a minimum

of δL among c.s. bodies [13]. It would be interesting to identify
a body which is such a minimum.
